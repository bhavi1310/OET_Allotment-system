You can create your own account.

# Note:
1. You can handle total numbers of students as per your need (You can alter that in submit_form.php, I have kept 100 students in TY and 100 in LY)
2. You can also handle total available seats in each course as per your need (You can alter that in allotment.php and allotment2.php, I have kept 20 seats for each course in TY as well as LY)
3. After the form is filled 100 times (check from database), then the admin can login and just press the allot button and the subject will be alloted to students according to their merit and preferences.
